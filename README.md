# Smart City Real-Time Streaming Pipeline

Built an end-to-end data pipeline simulating IoT streams such as vehicle telemetry, GPS, traffic, weather, and emergency incident data along a route (London to Birmingham).

- Orchestrated a containerized environment using Docker to manage Kafka, Zookeeper, Spark master and worker nodes, and AWS S3 for storage.
- Produced, streamed, and consumed JSON event data by configuring Kafka producers and Spark consumers using Python.
- Transformed and processed streaming data with Apache Spark and stored the results in AWS S3 for integration with BI tools.
